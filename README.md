# What is it?
A desktop application which is based on our nationâ€™s medical admission process. What it actually does is, assign students/candidates to their preferred medical colleges based on their merit with certain priorities like quota system. Modified stable marriage algorithm is used to solve this problem.

# About matching criteria
Is assigning students to colleges in some way can be considered acceptable? of course a criteria has to be maintained, so that assignment is valid and fair. But what is that criteria? That criteria is stability which is solved with stable marriage algorithm.

# Why modified stable marriage algorithm?
This matching problem already is solved by standard stable marriage algorithm. But our admission process has some additional priorities like quota system. Normal stable marriage algorithm doesn't give solution to this. Thus stable marriage algorithm is modified to solve this specific problem.
